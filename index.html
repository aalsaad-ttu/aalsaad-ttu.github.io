    <p>
      My goal in this course is to build a strong foundation in web-based
      project work by learning how to plan, structure, and document my work
      clearly. I want to better understand how tools like HTML and GitHub fit
      into a larger project management process.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a career perspective, I am working toward developing skills that are
      transferable to real-world professional environments. These include
      planning before execution, writing clear documentation, and organizing
      projects in a way that makes them easy to understand, update, and share.
